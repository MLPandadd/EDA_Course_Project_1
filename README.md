# EDA_Course_Project_1
Coursera Exploratory Data Analysis Course Project 1
1. All plots were created in one file, and broken into 4 files per course requirement.
2. plot_1.R, plot_2.R and plot_3.R have more comments than plot_4.R, as most of codes in plot_4.R are recycled for previous plots. 
3. Plots are stored in the the subfolder ./plots
